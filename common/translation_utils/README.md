## Translation files

`translations.csv` is the authorative source of translations that is used to create the PO files used on the website.
`translations_status.csv` lists the status of strings that are used in the code or have been used in the past.

### Context
e.g. BE, FE, Chatbot, Comment, Moderator

### django
True/False - comes with django and thus has translations for some locales
If sjango is True, the strings is assumed present in the codebase

### Tag
not needed - may appear on the site, but doesn't face front-end users
remove - should or has been removed from the code base
translate - should be translated

### Replacement strings
pipe (|) separated list of possible sensible replacements for the given string (These are intended to be from `translations.csv`)

### Replacement quality
good - this is a sensible replacement and should be applied
ok - this replacement is not ideal and should be replaced by a proper translation in the future
bad - [remove this tag]

### Status (autogenerated)
unused - the string does not appear in the codebase
not needed - the string appears in the codebase but does not need to be translated
has translation - the string appears in the codebase and a translation is present in `translations.csv`
needs translation - the string appears in the codebase and but there or no translations for it nor any of its replacement strings
TODO: either
	- tagged with 'remove' but still present in the codebase
    - tagged with 'translate', a translation for one of its replacements (but not the string itself) is present in `translations.csv`
Thus the first 3 require no action, 'TODO' has an actionable solution, 'needs translation' needs a better solution.

Thus, depending on various factors, the following Tag => Status updates are possible:
not needed => unused/not needed
remove => unused/has translation/TODO
translate => unused/has translation/needs translation/TODO


## To update `translations_status.csv`

From the root folder, run:
```
python3 manage.py makemessages -l xy -d django
python3 manage.py makemessages -l xy -d djangojs
```

From here, run:
```
update_status.py
```

If strings not present in `translations_status.csv` are found, their tag needs to be added manually.

## To update PO files

```
python3 make_testing_po.py
python3 make_pos.py
```

Note: Any entry different from 'remove' and 'not needed' is considered equivalent to 'translate'
